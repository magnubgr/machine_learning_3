# machine_learning_3
Machine learning project in FYS-STK4155/3155 looking into credit card fraud detection







We have made a testfunction for the data processor, but since we used scikitlearns
packages which has been heavily tested, we have not created test for these.
In order to run the test execute the command below
```
pytest -v
```
